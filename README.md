# Babel Skeleton

This skeleton repo consists of two commits: a minimal Babel setup, and a minimal React setup. (Ok, with the `README` file, now it's three commits.)

```
npm install
npm run build
```

Now you have your Babel, React, and Webpack dependencies installed, and a `bundle.js` in your `dist/` folder.
